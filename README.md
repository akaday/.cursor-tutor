# .cursor-tutor

## Description

This project provides a cursor for building extensions. The cursor allows developers to easily move and select text within their applications, and also provides a method for extending its functionality.

## Usage

To use the cursor, first import the `Cursor` class from the `cursor.js` file:

```javascript
import { Cursor } from './src/cursor.js';
```

Then, create an instance of the `Cursor` class and use its methods to move and select text:

```javascript
const cursor = new Cursor();
cursor.moveRight();
cursor.selectText();
```
